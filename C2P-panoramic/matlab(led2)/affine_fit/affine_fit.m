function [n,V,p] = affine_fit(X)
    %Computes the plane that fits best (lest square of the normal distance
    %to the plane) a set of sample points.
    %INPUTS:
    %
    %X: a N by 3 matrix where each line is a sample point
    %
    %OUTPUTS:
    %
    %n : a unit (column) vector normal to the plane
    %V : a 3 by 2 matrix. The columns of V form an orthonormal basis of the
    %plane
    %p : a point belonging to the plane
    %
    %NB: this code actually works in any dimension (2,3,4,...)

    %the mean of the samples belongs to the plane
    p = mean(X,1);%四个点每一行的均值
    
    %The samples are reduced:
    R = bsxfun(@minus,X,p);
    %Computation of the principal directions if the samples cloud
    [V,D] = eig(R'*R);%特征值的对角矩阵D，矩阵V
    %Extract the output from the eigenvectors
    n = V(:,1);%特征向量
